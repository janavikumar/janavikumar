I'm a data journalist with experience in mapping, interactive design, algorithmic development, and long-form writing. After working as a software engineer and an arts journalist, I'm merging my interests to help elevate stories hidden in the numbers.  My interests lie in cultural implications of public policy. I have reported on how a New York City basketball court of NBA legend is impacted by housing policy and how forced migration impacts the development and diffusion of music. Currently, I am attending Columbia University in the Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences program to study the intersection of narrative and data-driven journalism.
